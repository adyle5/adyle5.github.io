                I am a lead developer at Open Dealer Exchange with over 20 years experience in software development at Pfizer, American Express, FPL, ADP and others. I am an MCP, a former adjunct instructor at Broward College, and have presented at South Florida Code Camp.
                I have spent most of my career as a full stack developer working in .NET.

                I develop and maintain an open source C# extensions library called ExtensionsDotNet, which is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/adyle5/ExtensionsDotNet">[Github]</a>. The library is available through the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExtensionsDotNet/">[NUGET package repository]</a> and can be installed via Visual Studio, the dotnet CLI, or by downloading directly from NUGET. ExtensionsDotNet will make you a more productive developer by simplifying common coding tasks. I welcome you to try it out and please leave any feedback on my NUGET page. For more information on ExtensionsDotNet, please visit the project's <a href="https://github.com/adyle5/ExtensionsDotNet/wiki">[wiki]</a>.

                I am interested in open source software development using .NET, ASP.NET and Blazor. This website was written using those technologies along with several others. You can get more information about the technology used to
                build this site on the Technology Stack page.

                When not writing code, I enjoy collecting vinyl, playing chess, and photographing some of the unique and interesting wildlife near my home. You can view some of my photos on the <a href="/photography">[Photography]</a> page.
