Currently a Lead Developer at Open Dealer Exchange, I have 18 years experience in IT at Pfizer, American Express, FPL, ADP and others. I am an MCP and a former adjunct instructor at Broward Community College. I have spent most of my career using Microsoft technologies, but I love open source software and would like to help you do the same.
