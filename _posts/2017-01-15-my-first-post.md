This is my first post ever using my new [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I will be adding posts here about software development plus the occasional non-software related post about vinyl, Star Wars, Game of Thrones and more. I hope you enjoy it.

Currently, I am interested in open source .NET development and will be doing a lecture about it in March 2017. Please visit the [Code Camp](/code-camp) page for more details.
