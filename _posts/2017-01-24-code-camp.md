## {{ page.summary }}

South Florida Code Camp will be taking place on March 11, 2017 on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, FL. I am tentatively presenting a lecture on .NET development on Linux using .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, and Visual Studio Code. It will be a hands on session - so we will go from file > new to (hopefully) deploying a website to the cloud.

I will be adding things here as we get closer to Code Camp that I will use during the presentation, so check back.
