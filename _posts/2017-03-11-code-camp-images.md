Today was my South Florida Code Camp presentation on .Net Core and Visual Studio Code on Linux. It went great. I took a fresh VM with nothing on it and in 60 minutes we installed all the tool, app, and packages needed to develop open source .NET applications on Linux and deploy them to Azure. The room was packed, everyone seemed very engaged and asked excellent questions. I am looking forward to next year already.

Here are a few photos from the event. Thanks to my friend Damian for taking the photos.
