I've created a new site using Jekyll. Unlike other sites, I created this one mostly from scratch and not using a template.

<br />

The site is [SECSchedule.com](https://www.secschedule.com) and it allows you to see the complete 2017 football schedule for SEC teams, including Alabama, Auburn, LSU, Florida, and others.

<br />

Since the site is static, I use JSON instead of a db to store schedule information. It's not quite like a nosql solution, but pretty close.

<br />

I'd appreciate any comments or questions about the site - what you think I did right and wrong. And, if you are intereted in the content please bookmark it and let your friends know.
